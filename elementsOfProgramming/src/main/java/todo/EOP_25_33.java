   *25.33 FIND THE MAXIMUM 2D SUBARRAY Q<
   The following problem has applications to image processing.
   493
   Let A be an n X m Boolean 2Darray. Design efficient algorithms for the following two
   problems:
   • What is the largest 2D subarray containing only Is?
   • What is the largest square 2D subarray containing only Is?
   What are the time and space complexities of your algorithms as a function of n and
   m?
